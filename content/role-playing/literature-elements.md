## Overview

When writing something or thinking in terms of a role-playing game, a lot of
these next few items seem to get mixed together or not properly defined so when
someone discusses them, there is overlap or misinformation.

---

## Genre

Genre is what an overall idea of the universe or world, not to be confused with
how a Setting works.

---

## Setting

A Setting is a specific world such as DnD Everton or Magic the Gathering
Ravnica. Other examples can be Star Wars, Star Trek, The Expanse, or Firefly.

---

## Theme

A Theme is a bit harder to pin in a tree or one part. Theme is pervasive
throughout everything. A Genre's Theme can be Good vs. Evil, a Setting's Theme
could be equality for all. Each Scene can have its own Theme as well such as
tension, mystery, or action. However, each Theme can have multiple Tones
associated to it.

---

## Tone

Tone is the nuance of a Theme. Is this Theme going to be serious, or fast-paced?
Maybe it'll start happy then turn sad due to the player's actions.

---

## Adventures

Adventures are a string of turning points or scenes that convey plot points. An
Adventure has a location, goal, and obstacle to make the players make decisions
that impact the world or next scene.

---

## Turning Points

Turning Points or Scenes are made up of Plot Lines affected by Plot Points with
Characters and a Theme.

---

## Plot Lines

Plot Lines are what is supposed to happen but could change depending on what
choices players make.

---

## Plot Points

Plot Points are used to shape the Plot Line and drive interactions.

---

## Characters

Characters are who are called upon in a Turning Point to act upon a Plot Point.
