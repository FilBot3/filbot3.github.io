## What is solo role-playing?

Solo Role-Playing is when you assume the role of both Player and Game Master and
continue to tell a story and find out what happens next like you would in a
normal game. However, to help simulate the feel of randomness or make decisions
you use something called an `Oracle`. This Oracle helps determine the answer to
Yes or No questions. There are also things called `Seers` or `Muses`, but these
provide either combinations of words or pictures that are then used to answer
complex questions or random events or when you're just stuck.

There are many other better takes and implementations of solo role-playing.
These are things such as Word Mill Games' Mythic RPG, Mythic Game Master
Emulator, Geek Gamers' Solo Game Master's Guide, Parts-Per-Million and many
more. They each have their own methods for achieving the same thing: answering
what happens next. Some of these use percentile roles, others various books or
tables, and system-specific mechanics. Just like reading and understanding many
other role-playing systems helps to expand your understanding of the gaming
space, reading these books and tools helps you gain an understanding of solo
styled game play.

Some other tools I've used are:

* Runehammer's ICRPG Think Deck
* Runehammer's ICRPG Essentials Deck
* Word Mill Games' Mythic GM Emulator Deck
* Larcenous Designs' Game Master's Apprentice Deck(s)
* Rory's Story Cubes

I've also seen some people use Magic The Gathering cards, or just words from a
randomly selected page in a book.
