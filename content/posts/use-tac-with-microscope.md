## What are ya babblin' about?

I am proposing using Word Mill Games' _The Adventure Crafter_ to play or
generate _Microscope RPG_ Bookends, Periods, Events, and Scenes with _Mythic
Game Master Emulator_ sprinkled in for decision making and inspiration.

### Resources

- [Microscope PRG | Lame Mage Productions](https://www.lamemage.com/microscope/), [Itch.io](https://lamemage.itch.io/microscope), [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/91183/Microscope)
- [Mythic | Word Mill Games](https://wordmillgames.com/mythic.html), [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/422929/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator-Second-Edition)
- [The Adventure Crafter](https://wordmillgames.com/adventure-crafter.html), [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/261479/The-Adventure-Crafter)

## The Big Picture

- Pick a game
- Use Mythic Element Meaning Tables for inspiration as to the overarching topic.

## Bookend History

- Use _The Adventure Crafter_ to generate `Turning Points` for the BEGINNING and ENDING Bookends.
- The ENDING Bookend doesn't have to be a Conclusion, the future is unknown!
- **OPTIONAL**: Use each `Plot Point` as an EVENT when populating Events for Periods.
- **OPTIONAL**: Roll up all `Plot Points` into the Period's details.
- Determine `Tone` for each Period generated.

## The Palette

- Take 10 minutes to think on YES/NO items to keep/toss from your game.
- Be honest with yourself, explore your thoughts.
- Write 2-5 of each list (not required).
- **OPTIONAL**: Skip _The Palette_ step.

## Legacies

- _Legacies_ are common threads throughout the Periods, Events, and Scenes.
- **OPTIONAL**: Link to a MGME Thread or TAC Adventure plot.

## Order of Operations

Found on Microscope RPG page 18.

- Follow the Flow
- Declare the Focus
- Pick or Make history
- Ask Mythic "if this is a Legacy?"

## Forms of History

Found on Microscope RPG page 20.

- Periods (p.22)
	- Roll a 2d6+4 for the number of Periods to roll up.
	- Adjust as needed, maybe 2d4 + 4 if wanting smaller numbers.
- Events (p.24)
	- There should be at least 5 Events based upon the Plot Points.
- Scenes (p.29)
	- Scenes should come organically.

### Periods

- Decide when the Period is.
	- Roll a die or dice that is closest to the number of Periods created.
- Use the same procedures as the Bookend History.
- Decide on Tone (Light or Dark).
	- Use your expectations or intuition. Otherwise, ask a Yes/No 50/50 CF:5 question.
- Embellish a bit, you don't have to use a Turning Point verbatim.
- Try to avoid NONE results in Plot Points.

### Events

- Decide when the Event is.
	- Use the Period picking method.
	- Then roll a d10 or die closest to the number of Events.
- Use the Plot Points as the basis for the Event (try to at least).
- Use the MGME to embellish more details.
- Decide on the final Tone (Light or Dark).

### Scenes

- Purpose your scene, check against Chaos Factor, just like Mythic Game Master Emulator.
- Play out the Scene with MGME and/or your desired RPG.
- Use the Period and Event as Context for how to play your Scene and asking questions.
- Make liberal use of the MGME Meaning: Elements Tables.
