# My D6 Oracle Table

## Overview

This is a simple oracle table that is admidtely using the values from Ironsworn,
and the `The No-Prep Gamemaster` by Dicegeeks. It should be fairly simple. I use
this during my live sessions to cut down on the amount of cross-referencing of
tables and other things. Mythic Game Master Emulator's Fate Chart is great for
solo games or prep sessions.

## The Oracle

| dice: 1d6 | Oracle         | Scenario   |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 1         | Nope           | Worse Case |
| 2         | Almost Certain | Really Bad |
| 3         | Likely         | Bad        |
| 4         | 50/50          | Okay       |
| 5         | Unlikely       | Good       |
| 6         | Small Chance   | Best Case  |

A roll of 1 on the Oracle table is always a NOPE. Every other value is meet or
beat the value matching the odds of a Yes answer. The Scenario column adds
flavor to the result from the oracle. You may get a Yes answer, but it may not
be super favorable. Essentially, try to roll high on both columns.
