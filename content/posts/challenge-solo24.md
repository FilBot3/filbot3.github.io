## Overview

At the beginning of 2023, Sean McCoy put out a challenge that each day, creators
create a room of a dungeon a day that builds into mega dungeon of sorts. Then
keep all of this in a journal for future use. This was called Dungeon23 for
2023. It's a practice of patience and making sure to stick with something.

I want to propose a challenge for 2024 called Solo24.

## Solo24

These are the rules.

- Each day, play out a Scene building a Plot Point.
- Each week constitutes a Turning Point in an Adventure.
- Each month constitutes as an Adventure of 4 or 5 Turning Points.
- At the end of the year, should have a Campaign consisting of 12 Adventures.

These are the conditions.

- Pick/Roll for a Genre and Setting and stick to this.
- Try to use different Themes and Tones for each Turning Point or Adventure.
- If you fall behind and miss a day, do not try to catch up unless you want to.
	- This will not build good habits.

The Goal(s) is/are:

- Be consistent.
- Finish something you start.
- Learn to pace and end Scene, Adventure, Campaign.
	- Useful even for a Sandbox game.
